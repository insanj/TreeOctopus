THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST TREE OCTOPUS PLUGIN

With this plugin, relive the tale! Place a gold block on a leaf, or hit a leaf with a gold ingot, and a message will pop up saying: "Sacrifice accepted. You have summoned the all mighty tree octopus!", and like magic, your sacrifice will be taken and replaced with a glorious squid. Don't believe it? Try it for yourself!
