THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST TREE OCTOPUS PLUGIN

According to the "tree octopus" website, this kind of octopus is an extremely endangered species that lives in the tress in a very small portion of the world. The website instructed people to help save the tree octopus by putting money up in the trees so that the tree octopuses could make nests out of the bills. Of course, this was a scam just to get people to put money in trees for other people to take. (http://zapatopi.net/treeoctopus/)

This is a comical plugin for this tree octopus. By placing a gold block on top of a tree/leaves, a message pops up for player saying: "Sacrifice accepted. You have summon the all mighty tree octopus!" Then, a mighty squid appears, replacing the sacrifice!
